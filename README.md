# NEAT-PONG
Using NEAT-Python to train pong

We use the NEAT-python package to train a homemade version of Pong.

pong_game.py -- This is a version of the game in which two players can battle.
pong_training_right.py -- This uses NEAT to train an AI playing on the right side of the screen.
config-feedforward.txt -- The config file with the parameters NEAT requires. It is necessary for pong_training_right.py to work.
pong_vs_AI.py -- This is a version of the game in which the player controls the left side, and the right side is controlled by the FFNN from NEAT. (needs to be coded)
